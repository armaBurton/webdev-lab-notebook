## Reflection Document

### HTML

The HTML was fairly straightforward and I didn't have any trouble with it. Tables are kind of annoying, but it sure beats having to make a photo shop document that had to be sliced and then dropped into tables. That's how I learned web design originally if I recall correctly, and that turned me off of web development until HTML5/CSS3 came out.

### Accessibility

Accessibility was a little bit tedious, but wave made it simpler. In the past I just slapped aria-labels on everything and hoped for the best. The ADA was interesting, I used to work as a production sign designer and ADA was something I had to think about often.

### CSS

I still really dislike Bootstrap. I prefer to use vanilla CSS. I feel like I have more control over what I'm doing, even if I have to type more. I did learn some tricks about making Bootstrap lists so I didn't have to write the same Bootstrap CSS over and over. I don't remember if I use it here or on the homework.
